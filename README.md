## More about me

Take a look at my <abbr title="Curriculum vitae">CV</abbr> (or resum√©) at [ndorfin.github.io/cv](https://ndorfin.github.io/cv/) or browse my personal site at [tactile.co.za](https://tactile.co.za/)

## Current work

I'm currently on contract at Stellenbosch University, working with the [CREST team](https://www0.sun.ac.za/crest/) on their SASTI analytics platform. (Reporting on tertiary education performance in South Africa). SASTI is written in Python/Django, and I'm responsible for upgrading the UI aspects using:

- a bespoke Pattern Library
- Jinja2
- HTML5
- Modern CSS
- Progressive-enhancement
- Web Components
- Web Performance Optimisations

## Personal projects

In my personal time, I'm working on a [Django conversion of Birds of Zevenwacht](https://github.com/ndorfin/birds-of-zevenwacht/tree/django)
The site was previously created with Eleventy ([11ty.dev](https://11ty.dev)). I'm using this both as a learning exercise, and to add interactive features for the site. (Allowing users to upload their own Photos/Sightings, etc)

## HTML Web Components

I love working on and publishing little parcels of progressive-enhancement. Some of my previous components include:

- [Chart.js Web Component wrapper](https://github.com/ndorfin/chartjs-web-component)\
  Render simple charts with just a few lines of HTML
- [`&lt;multi-options&gt;`](https://github.com/ndorfin/multi-options-webcomponent)\
  Progressively enhance a series of form fields to create a tag/category selection, or multi-options form control.
- `&lt;tab-group&gt;`\
  Progressively-enhance a table of contents and their relevant sections into an accessible tab group.
- [`&lt;prog-lightbox&gt;`](https://github.com/ndorfin/prog-lightbox)\
  Turn an anchor (that points to a larger image), into a modal lightbox.
