## Latest project work

I've just wrapped up a contract at Stellenbosch University, working with the [CREST team](https://www0.sun.ac.za/crest/) on their SASTI analytics platform. (Reporting on tertiary education performance in South Africa). SASTI is written in Python/Django. I've been responsible for upgrading the UI aspects using:

- a bespoke Pattern Library
- Jinja2
- HTML5, Modern CSS, and SVG
- Progressive-enhancement with Web Components

## Pet projects

In my personal time, I'm working on a [Django conversion](https://github.com/ndorfin/birds-of-zevenwacht/tree/django) of [Birds of Zevenwacht](https://ndorfin.github.io/birds-of-zevenwacht/).\
The site was previously created with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev). I'm using this both as a learning exercise, and to add interactive features for the site. (Allowing users to upload their own Photos/Sightings, etc)

### HTML Web Components

I love working on and publishing little parcels of progressive-enhancement. Some of my previous components include:

- [`<wc-chart>` - a Chart.js Web Component wrapper](https://github.com/ndorfin/chartjs-web-component)\
  Render simple charts with just a few lines of HTML
- [`<multi-options>` - a form field for folksonomy](https://github.com/ndorfin/multi-options-webcomponent)\
  Progressively enhance a series of form fields to create a tag/category selection form control
- `<tab-group>`\
  Progressively-enhance a table of contents and their relevant sections into an accessible tab group
- [`<prog-lightbox>`](https://github.com/ndorfin/prog-lightbox)\
  Turn an anchor (that points to a larger image), into a modal lightbox
